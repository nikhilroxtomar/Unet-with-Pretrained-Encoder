# Unet-with-Pretrained-Encoder

The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that perform semantic segmentation using the famous U-Net. The encoder of the U-Net is replaced with the pretrained encoder.
The pretrained encoder that we used with U-net are:
- MobileNetV2
- ResNet50

## Dataset
CVC-612 or ClinicDB polyp dataset is used for semantic segmentation task. The dataset contains the 612 images and masks. You can download the dataset from <a href="https://polyp.grand-challenge.org/CVCClinicDB/">here</a> or from directly from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5qe9eotetjnbmq/CVC-ClinicDB.rar?dl=0">Dropbox</a>.
